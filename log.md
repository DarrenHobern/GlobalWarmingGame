This is where I will keep track of how development of the game is going.


**2018:**
-  10 July: Project start
  - Did some research on hex grids and decided to use a [library](https://aurelwu.itch.io/hexmaplibrary) to handle it for me, basically to save time.
  - Created this log.
  - Started Digitising the design doc and did more work on it.
  - Started creating mood board to get an idea of art style.
