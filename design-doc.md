Game is an arcade survival game about putting out literal and figurative fires. The player is given the task of minimising the damage caused by ever increasing natural disasters. They will need to prioritise and juggle tasks to prevent disaster.

### Gameplay:
- The player moves about a flat plane divided into hexagonal tiles with 3D structures and environments within.
- The map is broken up into regions of urban, rural, and wild areas.
- Throughout the game, natural disasters will strike: tornades, earthquakes, thunderstorms, etc.
- The player must put out fires, divert floods, and evacuate peoples to reduce damage of these events.
- If left unchecked, fires will spread causing ever more damage.
- The player earns currency which they can use to upgrade themselves or the environment.
  - Upgrading the player will increase the skill at dealing with a specific type of threat, such as fires, or floods.
  - Upgrading the environment could be improving roads for increased speed. Or fortifying defenses to earthquakes.
- End with heat death.

### Expansion & Future Plans:
- NPCs which attempt to help. Probably only slow down or handle small events.
  - Can be upgraded to be better.
- Multiplayer: either cooperative or versus.
  - In versus mode it could be FFA or teams, opposing teams will control which events (or add events on top of the regular ones) are sent to each other.
- An electricity or resource mechanic: where you can make things like solar, wind, or coal power stations. These could speed up the rate of global warming adding a trade off between short term benifit and long term consiquences.
- Political unrest: the peoples are divided on the state of the world and aren't always helpful.
- Seasons: The time of year affects what disasters occur.
- Unnatural disasters: Biochemical, nuclear, etc. Aliens?
- Customisation
- More disaster types
